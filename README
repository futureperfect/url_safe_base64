UrlSafeBase64
=============

Converts strings to/from a slightly modified base64 that contains only url-safe characters

This fork simply removes the Rails-specific stuff and packages the code as a standalone class

Examples
========

Normal:

>> Base64.encode64 "Test string"
=> "VGVzdCBzdHJpbmc=\n"

>> Base64.decode64 "VGVzdCBzdHJpbmc=\n"
=> "Test string"

With this gem:

>> UrlSafeBase64.encode64 "Test string"
=> "VGVzdCBzdHJpbmc"

>> UrlSafeBase64.decode64 "VGVzdCBzdHJpbmc=\n"
=> "Test string"
